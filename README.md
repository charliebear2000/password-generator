# Password Generator
***

## General Info
I was provided with the starter code for a webpage that will generate a password. The html and css files were done. I had to write the java code to create the password and display it on the screen. The specification for the assignment were:
* A click of the button will start a series of prompts.
* A prompt will ask how long to make the password.
* There must be prompts that ask the user for the criteria to include in the password.
* Prompts will ask to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.
* There needs to be a confirmation alert after each criteria.
* At least one type needs to be selected.
* The password will then be displayed either in an alert or written to the page.
